                                    Clarichat is a web application that simulated a behavioural job interview using an AI chatbot. 
                                    The chatbot will then analyse the user's responses and provide feedback on their performance 
                                    through multiple statistics. The application was built using React.js, Node.js, Firebase and 
                                    integrating ChatGPT API to simulate interviews with contextual responses to 50+ questions based 
                                    on the chosen role/position.

                                    I collaborated in a team of 5 to develop an AI-driven web app in 14 weeks which we employed employed 
                                    Agile methodologies with bi-weekly sprints on Azure Boards, managing code with Git/GitHub, working on individual 
                                    branches, and merging updates to master for seamless integration. We also implemented CI/CD using Azure Pipelines 
                                    and GitHub Actions, achieving over 95% pipeline success rate and 100% test coverage through automated unit testing 
                                    and deployment. Firebase was utilised as the main database for this monolithic application which handled user 
                                    authentication, updating of interview questions, responses, and history.

                                    The DrumoCat program is an interactive application developed in Processing that connects to a MIDI e-drum kit. At its core, 
                                    the program features a cat character situated behind a drum kit, whose arms move to strike the corresponding drum parts on-screen 
                                    with preloaded sound files (e.g., snare.wav, kick.wav) providing the audio.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Key features include recording drum inputs, saving sequences, and applying transformations like quantization (snapping beats to a tempo) 
                                    and BPM adjustments (modifying timestamps rather than playback speed). Additional tools include an MP3 player, 
                                    BPM tapper, metronome, intro trimming, and drumbeat visualizers.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Initially, implementing quantization seemed impossible when working with .wav or .mp3 files, as there was no direct access to 
                                    manipulate individual drum sounds or timings. This limitation forced me to reevaluate my approach. Instead of recording system sound, 
                                    I designed a system to record MIDI-like data by capturing the timestamp (in milliseconds), pitch (drum part), and velocity (strike intensity).
                                    I created a MidiEvent class to store this data, along with an ArrayList called recordedEvents to log the input and another sequenceFiles 
                                    list to manage loaded drum beats for manipulation. With the drumbeat stored in memory, quantization became feasible. 
                                    To quantize, I calculated the duration of a quarter note in milliseconds based on the BPM using: 1 (ms) = 60,000 / BPM. 
                                    For example, at 120 BPM, 1 beat = 500ms (4/4 time signature only). Quantizing snapped each event's timestamp to the nearest beat division.

                                    Features: Users can write entries based on how they are feeling, including an entry of their day/context to how they are feeling and a 
                                    selected mood to display how they felt. Users can also delete those same entries. Users can see their statistics regarding the entries. 
                                    For example, percentages are calculated for each mood, the amount of entries per month, and total entries. Statistics are also calculated 
                                    for each month, so users can filter by month and updates in real time. Users are also able to view the current weather and temperature 
                                    for their local area. Users can talk to a specialised AI chatbot that will provide them with quality information and recommendations 
                                    based on the information that the user gives them. Users can view their entries for each month based on a calendar UI; only dates that 
                                    have entries will be clickable. When users click on a day that has entries, users can view their entries for the day and can update them.

                                    PacStudent was my introduction to game development and Unity, spanning three intense assessment tasks that pushed my skills to the limit. 
                                    My spin-off reimagined Pac-Man with a dragon as the player and knights as the ghosts. Throughout the project, I managed Git branches for 
                                    different features, structured the Unity project efficiently, and created custom sprites in Piskelapp. I also designed sound effects using 
                                    BFXR and implemented core mechanics like movement, UI elements (score, lives, timer), and collision handling. Additionally, I added features 
                                    like persistent high scores. This experience highlighted the complexity of even a "simple" game and reinforced the importance of planning, 
                                    problem-solving, and continuous learning in game development.

                                    Methodology: To test transfer learning, I trained three models across two games—Street Fighter II and Fatal Fury 2—and used additional 
                                    untrained models for comparison. A custom environment was developed, featuring preprocessing techniques like grayscaling, 
                                    frame resizing, and stacking the last four frames. This gave the AI temporal context, allowing it to ‘see’ how the environment 
                                    changes over time and react strategically.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Results: In Street Fighter II, the baseline model (M1) achieved a high win rate of 83%, compared to an empty model’s 52%. When tested on Fatal Fury 2 
                                    without fine-tuning, the transferred model still outperformed the empty model on Fatal Fury 2 which averaged a 7%, where the Street Figher II 
                                    model achieved a 34% win rate. Fine-tuning M1 by training the model on Fatal Fury (M3) improved this to 36%, but training from scratch on 
                                    Fatal Fury (M2) yielded a slightly higher win rate of 39%. This demonstrates that although transfer learning without fine tuning yields 
                                    strong performance when compared to the likes of an empty model, fine-tuning is essential for domain adaptation. But even then the model 
                                    from scratch still outperformed the fine tuned model. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    However, there is an interesting observation. When training the model on Fatal Fury 2 with weights transferred from Street Fighter II (M3) 
                                    compared to training a model from scratch on Fatal Fury 2 (M2),the model with transferred weights (M3) significantly outperformed the model 
                                    trained from scratch until eventually they both broke even at around 2.644M timestep as seen in this graph, where the M3 is the red line and 
                                    M2 is the blue line. A significant claim can be made highlighting that transfer learning does indeed work and does save a significant amount 
                                    of time, as compared to just training the model from scratch (M2). I then tested M3 on Street Fighter II again to see if it retained the 
                                    peformance it was initially trained on and surprising it did with a relative high win rate of 77%, proving transfer learning's generalisation.

                                    The website you're currently viewing right now. I built this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a means to have my own personal website
                                    where I can showcase my work, experiences and projects as well as my journey in tech and as a Software Developer. It was about time I had my own
                                    website after years of putting it off, but here it is and you're looking at it right now. I will continue to update this website as I progress
                                    through my career and add more projects and experiences to it. I also used the Web3Forms API to handle the contact form, so yes, the contact

                                    Title: Using Sentiment Analysis to Compare Critics and Audience Movie Reviews
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This research project was conducted in collaboration with five other academic peers under the supervision of a 
                                    postgraduate researcher and was part of my Computing Science Studio 2, a subject designed to simulate real 
                                    industry research experience.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The project explores the differences between online movie reviews provided by critics and audiences through sentiment analysis. 
                                    By leveraging the pretrained RoBERTa model from Hugging Face, we analyzed large datasets of movie reviews, classifying sentiments 
                                    as positive, neutral, or negative.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The research aimed to uncover key distinctions in how critics and audiences evaluate movies. 
                                    While critics often focus on cinematic elements such as storytelling, direction, and underlying themes, 
                                    audiences primarily base their reviews on entertainment value and emotional resonance. Our findings revealed 
                                    that critics tend to be more analytical and provide a wider range of scores, whereas audiences generally rate 
                                    movies based on enjoyment, leading to a narrower score range.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The project also highlights how nostalgia plays a significant role in audience reviews, especially for genres like real-life drama and 
                                    children's movies. On the other hand, genres perceived as formulaic, such as comedy and horror, tend to receive lower scores from critics. 
                                    Understanding these differences provides valuable insights for filmmakers, critics, and audiences alike.
